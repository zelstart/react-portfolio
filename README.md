## Description
This is the repo for my professional React Portfolio website, which I have deployed using Netlify. It contains a few different pages, including an about me page where I introduce myself and my skills and goals, a portfolio page which lists some of my projects, a resume page where you can download my resume, and a contact me page where people can submit their name, email and a message so that they can get in touch with me. 

## Screenshots

Please note that this website is mobile friendly on screens as small as 380px wide! Anything smaller than that will look funny :)
