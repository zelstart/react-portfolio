                                    Hello! My name is Zel. I am just entering the world of web development. I am currently on track to graduate the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp from UNH in mid december! Here's a bunch of text blah blah blah. Gotta write more stuff. Wow. Look at all these things. Could I have used lorem ipsum here? Yeah. Did I feel like finding the generator? No. So here is some stuff.
                                </p>
                                <p className='about-me-text'>
                                    Stream of conciousness right onto the page. I wonder how many times a year I think about the Clone Wars. It's gotta be at least two or three times a week. Is this my Roman Empire? It's just. The characters. They're all so lovable. Plo Koon? Plo's Bro's? So wholesome. Fuck the emperor that guy was such a jerk, RIP to my homie Plo Koon.
                                </p>

                                    Wow! Still need to say more? Okay... Well. I have three cats and they're my lil babies. I love them. My oldest is named Riku and he's only got three legs! But he's such a lil trooper. Andi is second oldest and she is an absolute princess. The most well behaved cat I've ever met. Then there's Nyx. He's the youngest, anxious-est, and sweetest! He's very gentle and loving.
